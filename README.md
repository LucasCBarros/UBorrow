## Description
An iOS App to assist users in keeping tracking of all the items they have borrowed. I have forgot with whom I lent a book many times! The app offers a seemless user experience by intuitively indicating the return deadline using the gradual change of border color on each item, getting darker until it's due! 

## About

The application initiated as a challenge from when I was specializing in iOS development at Apple Developer Academy @ Eldorado back in Brazil. It was available in the App Store for two years until I couldn't keep maintaining it anymore.

### Overview

Find an extensive option of features with an initual gama of examples so you can try each feature yourself while using the app. 
- See each obejct and intuitively check if it's near the return deadline by keeping tack of the border colors
- Create a quick lend without needing to worry about details such as dates and notes
- Or borrow something taking detailed note of the persons information and setting deadlines
